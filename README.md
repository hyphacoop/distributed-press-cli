## Installation

### Node.js and npm Setup

To use `dp-cli`, youâ€™ll need Node.js and npm. Please refer to the [Node.js official documentation](https://nodejs.org/) to install Node.js. Once installed, npm (Node Package Manager) will be available, allowing you to run commands like `npx` and `npm`.

- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js. Verify installation by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

For additional help with npm commands, see the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

### Using npx

You can use `dp-cli` without installation by running:

```bash
npx dp-cli <command>
```

### Global Installation with npm

To install `dp-cli` globally, use:

```bash
npm install -g dp-cli
```

Once installed, you can use `dp-cli` from anywhere in your terminal.

## Setup

Before using the CLI, you need to generate a keypair, set your authentication token, and register your ActivityPub actor.

### Generate a Keypair

Run the following command to generate a new RSA keypair:

```bash
dp-cli generate-keypair
```

**Purpose:**  
This keypair is used for authenticating your interactions with the Social Inbox, ensuring secure communication and verifying your identity.

**Note:**  
If you only plan to use the DP API for static file publishing, generating a keypair might not be necessary. However, it's recommended for enhanced security and functionality when interacting with the Social Inbox.

This will generate a keypair and save it to your `.dprc` configuration file.

### Register as Publisher (Trial Account)

Register a trial publisher account on Distributed Press using your email:

```bash
dp-cli register-publisher
```

You will be prompted for your name and email. Note: currently, only one site per email is allowed.

### OR Set Your Authentication Token Manually

Obtain your `authToken` from your Distributed Press API administrator and set it using:

```bash
dp-cli set-auth-token
```

You will be prompted to enter your authentication token.

### Register Your Actor

Register your ActivityPub actor with the Social Inbox:

```bash
dp-cli register-actor
```

**Prompts:**

1. **Enter your actor username:**  
   _(e.g., "@username@yourdomain.com")_

2. **Enter your actor URL:**  
   _(e.g., "https://yourdomain.com/actor")_

3. **Enter your public key ID:**  
   _(e.g., "https://yourdomain.com/actor#main-key")_

This will register your actor with the Social Inbox and save the details to your configuration.

## Configuration

The CLI uses a configuration file named `.dprc` to store API URLs, authentication tokens, keypairs, and actor information. The configuration file follows the format expected by the [`rc` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc), which loads configuration options in a flexible way.

### Configuration File Structure

Your `.dprc` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "dpApiUrl": "https://api.distributed.press/v1",
  "socialInboxUrl": "https://social.distributed.press/v1",
  "authToken": "<your-auth-token>",
  "keypair": {
    "publicKeyPem": "<your-public-key>",
    "privateKeyPem": "<your-private-key>"
  },
  "actorUsername": "<your-actor-username>",
  "actorUrl": "<your-actor-url>",
  "publicKeyId": "<your-public-key-id>"
}
```

- **`dpApiUrl`:** The base URL for the Distributed Press API.
- **`socialInboxUrl`:** The base URL for the Social Inbox.
- **`authToken`:** Your authentication token for API access.
- **`keypair`:** Your public and private keys for secure interactions.
- **`actorUsername`:** Your ActivityPub actor username.
- **`actorUrl`:** The URL of your actor.
- **`publicKeyId`:** The ID of your public key.

_Ensure that your `.dprc` file is **not** committed to version control to keep your credentials secure._

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can use the `dp-cli` command followed by specific commands to interact with the APIs.

### Send a Post to Followers

Publish a post to your followers:

```bash
dp-cli send-post --message "Hello, Fediverse!"
